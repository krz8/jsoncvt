/** ptrvec is just used to make creating pointer-to-pointer lists
 *  (like an argv) easy to build. It automatically manages its memory,
 *  reallocating when necessary, and so on.
 *
 *  Expected usage is something like
 *
 *  1. Obtain new ptrvec via pvnew(), or initialize one to all zeroes.
 *
 *  2. Use pvadd() to add pointers to the vector. The underlying
 *  vector is always null terminated, even while building, so you can
 *  access the in-progress vector safely via p.
 *
 *  3. Use pvdup() to create a new void** that is exactly the size
 *  needed for the resulting string, or use pvfinal() below. The
 *  elements of the vector are just copied; only the vector itself is
 *  allocated anew.
 *
 *  4. Free up any current space space via pvclear(), resetting things
 *  to "empty" again. Set a hard size via pvsize().
 *
 *  5. if you called pvnew() earlier, call pvdel() to free it. If you
 *  just want to free up the memory it uses but not the ptrvec itself,
 *  call pvclear(). pvfinal() combines both pvdup() and pvclear(). */
